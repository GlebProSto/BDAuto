🚗 Car Database Schema (SQLite)
A normalized relational database schema for managing automotive data using SQLite.

This project models real-world car information including:

Brands, models, and production eras
Countries of origin
Body types, engine types, and drivetrains
Individual vehicles with VIN, horsepower, weight, and power-to-weight ratio
✨ Features:

Full referential integrity with foreign keys
Computed columns (e.g., power_to_weight_ratio, production_status)
Data validation via CHECK constraints
Automatic change logging with triggers
Indexes for performance optimization
Perfect for learning database design, SQLite features, or as a foundation for car-related applications.
